How OpenWrt interacts with MC(microcontollers), WEB, CLOUD, Mobile phones ... (using MQTT)

Let say we have a local water system(LWS) that we use for watering process and main water system to fill a tank.
The local water system will take water from the tank using its own pump.
To fill the tank we will use a bobber inside the tank. When level of water is lower then we set MC will recieve a signal to open a valve
for MWS. After the tank is filled out and bobber achieves top level we set MC will recieve a signal to close the valve for MWS.

Main components of LWS are tank, pump, set of valves and sensors. Various devices for the watering can be connected to valves through pipes or hoses.
Valves are handled by MC through relays. Sensors are connected to MC.


CRON
   OUTPUT
+    - to WATERING send Begin/End for valves(by name ?)
  	 - to ??? devices monitoring

plugin WATERING
   INPUT
+    - from CRON Begin/End for valves
+	 - from WEB/CLOUD Start/Stop signal for valve/valves(ALLSTOP/ALLSTART)  
	 - from MC
	      - change status after Begin/End command
		  - information from sensors
   OUTPUT    
+    - to MC send Begin/End command (Start/Stop command should be analised and if nesessary transformed into Begin/End),
	    ???  analise information from some kind of sensors like rain starts, pump is on/of, bobber (to open/close valve from main water system);
	 - record to DB (directly or throughout separate driver)
	      - change valve's status after recieving from MC;
		  - write information from sensors;

MC
    INPUT
+	  - from WATERING Begin/End command;
	OUTPUT
	  - to WATERING:
+	      - switch on status
	      - change valve's status;
		  - send information from sensors;


WEB server
	OUTPUT
+	  - to WATERING send Start/Stop for valves(by name ?)

!!!!!    on work now

MC 
       - send information from rain sensor (START ALL/ STOP ALL)
	      there are two(or even three) ways how to use rain sensor:
		  1. use digital pin on controller + interrupt when value on pin is chenhed;
		  2. use analog pin and check the value on this pin - if it is lower or higher and previous state of flag is different - send message and change value of flag;
		  3. use both, send messages from both to plugin. plugin will write this information in DB for farther analysis.
		  I am about to use 3'th path for test purpose.
		  
	   - pressure sensor + relay + pump
	   - bober + relay + input valve

plugin WATERING
  INPUT    
	   - analyze information from some kind of sensors like rain starts, pump is on/of, bobber (to open/close valve from main water system);
	   

Maybe it woth to consider the situation with one more flag/status(new field in DB) for devices/sensors. as variant "is_blocked". it means 
individual "is_stopped" status. it is neseccery for example in case when some device need to be stoped for some time for some reason and
then when it is raining  "StopAll" message is sending. After rain is finished "AllStart"  message will be sent and all devices would be
unblocked even though we don't want to unblock the device that was stopped manually.


??? for future
 --- ? what if a sensor is not plugged or broken ?
